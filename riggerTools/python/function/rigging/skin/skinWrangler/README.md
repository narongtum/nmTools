skinWrangler
============

This is a tool that I wrote for the proprietary Zeno software when at ILM years ago. It's largely based on the old 3dsMax Character Studio skin weight utility. In my spare time I decided to re-write it in Maya to help with the sheer amount of skinning work my team had at Crytek on Ryse: Son of Rome.
