To install the Corrective Blendshape Model Helper, there is a 2 part process.


Step 1 : Run runMe.bat

Step 2 : drag runMe.mel into your Maya window. That will finish the setup process and add a button to your currently selected shelf.

Be sure to do it in that order. If not, bad things will happen. Not really, but it won't work.

That should be it. If you run in to problems or have any suggestions, email me at nalzay89@gmail.com. Happy Rigging.
